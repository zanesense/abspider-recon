## 🔒 Security & Authentication

ABSpider leverages **Supabase** for robust and passwordless user authentication. Users gain access via a **Magic Link** sent to their email, eliminating the need to manage passwords and enhancing security. Access to the dashboard is strictly enforced, ensuring only authorized users can initiate scans and view sensitive data.

---

## 📑 Detailed Reporting & Integrations

### 📄 Comprehensive PDF Reports

Our reports are designed for professional security analysis and include:

*   **Executive Summary** and overall security grade.
*   **Module-by-Module Findings** with raw evidence.
*   Vulnerability severity & **confidence scores**.
*   Reproducible steps & **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** snippets.
*   Actionable remediation recommendations for discovered flaws.

### 🔗 Seamless Integrations

*   **Discord Webhooks:** Real-time scan completion notifications and alerts.
*   **Local Storage:** Persists scan history and settings locally within the browser for convenience.
*   **Export Options:** Provides findings in **PDF / JSON** formats for triage and submission.

### 🔑 Optional API Keys (Enhance Your Recon)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Client-Side Accessible API Key Storage**
> API keys are stored in your Supabase database, but are still accessible client-side. This means any Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability or physical access to your browser could expose these keys.
> **DO NOT store sensitive, paid, or production API keys here.** This feature is intended for testing with non-critical keys only. For production use, a secure backend for API key management is strongly recommended.

## ⚖️ Legal Notice & Ethical Use

ABSpider is strictly for **authorized security testing only**.

**Unauthorized scanning** of domains you do not own or do not have **explicit written permission** to test may be illegal. Always comply with applicable local, state, and international laws. **Use responsibly.**

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT WARNING: Authorized Use Only**
> *   You may **ONLY** scan websites and systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test.
> *   Unauthorized scanning may be illegal in your jurisdiction.
> *   You are solely responsible for ensuring you have proper authorization. Keep documentation of authorization for all scans performed.
> *   Comply with all applicable laws including Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), GDPR, and local regulations.
> *   Unauthorized access to computer systems is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Penalties may include fines, imprisonment, and civil liability.
> *   This tool does not grant permission to scan any system.

> ⚠️ **WARNING: Internal Targets**
> Scanning internal IP addresses or `localhost` without explicit authorization is highly discouraged and may be illegal. The tool will warn you if an internal target is detected.

> ⚠️ **WARNING: Public CORS Proxy Risks**
> Using public CORS proxies can expose your target URLs, headers, and response content to the proxy operators. For sensitive operations, consider setting up a self-hosted, trusted CORS proxy or using a direct fetch only mode. The security and reliability of these third-party services are not guaranteed.
